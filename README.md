What is this?
=============

This is a simple repo I made with some base files for a django project.

I have an immediate template, a urls.py, a views.py with a single view
in it, a make file for compiling all the less and coffee files, and even
a local settings file.

Why?
====

This took me about 45 minutes to make. While, in the grand scheme of a
project, that's not much time, I just wanted to shave that off of future
stuff. Anything lowering my 0-60 on starting a new webapp is a great
thing.

Cool, can I contribute?
=======================

Absolutely. Fork and pull, baby...

I'll probably be tweaking this over time, but this is all I have right
now. If you have a useful suggestion, make it for yourself in your own
fork, use it for a bit, see if it is something that works for you, and
send me a pull request. I can't garuntee that I'll incorporate it, as
this is really more geared to my own workflow, and anyone elses, but I
just may. ;-)

Who and the hell are you, dude?
